# List - SwiftUI


Hello! In this video, we will create a list with data using SwiftUI. We will learn how to move, delete, and add items to the list. Additionally, you will discover how to change the background color of each cell in the list.

At the beginning of the video, we will create a data structure to store the list items. Based on this structure, we will create a list with items that can be moved and deleted.

After that, we will add a button for adding new items to the list. This will allow us to expand the list as needed.
In the final part of the video, we will learn how to change the background color of each cell in the list to make it more vibrant and appealing.
As a result, you will have a functional list with the ability to manage items and customize the appearance of the cells.
